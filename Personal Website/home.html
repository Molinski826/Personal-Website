            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I was born in Toledo, OH and attended The Ohio State University and The University of Toledo. After college I moved to Florida
                to play golf for a living. After almost a decade in Florida, I moved back to Toledo. I have an extensive background in employment across many fields.

            <h2>Developing</h2>
            <p>At the age of 22 I built a html website for a golf course that I was woring at. Developing, coding, and anything computer related have been a passion of
                mine for many years. It has only been recently that I have been afforded the oppertunity to dive head first into the ndustry.
